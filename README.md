## Requirements

- [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets) account (or any other trading platform with an accessible API)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free) account (only the free tier is needed)
- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) account
- [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com) (Alexa will also work)

## Setting up Alpaca

1. [Sign up](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup) for an Alpaca account.

2. If you'd like to trade with real money, click `Individual Account` and fill in all the required information. To do paper trading, no additional information is necessary. Simply click `Go to Paper Account` on the top-left. I'm using a Paper Trading account, but most of the steps should be similar across both.

3. You should now be on the Overview Dashboard page, and on the right side you'll see a section titled `Your API Keys`. Click `View` to expand the section and then `Generate New Key`. **Copy your API Key ID and Secret Key, as you won't be able to see it again** unless you generate a new one. These will be used in the next section when [creating the Lambda function](#creating-the-lambda-function).
